FIND DIFFERENT INSTANCE OF THIS PROBLEM!

actually optimal solution. For this I should investigate the differences between the CallbackMIP and my testerILP,
regarding input and execution.
ATTEMPTS:
- Execution: the two MIPs CallbackMIP and testerILP are the same (Since they work in different environments the code is slightly
different, but they should do exactly the same thing).
- Inputs:
